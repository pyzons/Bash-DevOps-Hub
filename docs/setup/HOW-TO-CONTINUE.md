# 🚀 How to Continue Where You Left Off

## 📋 **Quick Recovery Checklist**

### 🔄 **After Any Break (Same Session)**
```powershell
# Navigate to your workspace
cdws                    # Quick alias to c:\app\ws

# Check your environment status
Check-DockerReady      # Verify Docker is running
gs                     # Check git status
kind-list              # See if any clusters are running
```

### 🔄 **After Logout/Reboot (Fresh Session)**
```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell 7 (your profile auto-loads!)
# 2. Navigate to workspace
cdws

# 3. Verify your environment
Check-DockerReady      # Wait for Docker Desktop if needed
gs                     # Check git status

# 4. Restore your development environment
kind-dev-setup         # Create fresh KIND cluster
K8s-Status            # Verify cluster is ready

# 5. Restore your work (if you had running applications)
# Option A: From Git
kap your-manifests/

# Option B: From backup
kind-restore-resources c:\app\ws\k8s-backups\your-backup.yaml
```

### 🔄 **After System Restart/New Machine**
```powershell
# 1. Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/pyzons/powershell-enhanced-profile.git c:\app\ws
cd c:\app\ws

# 2. Install the profile
.\Install-Profile.ps1

# 3. Restart PowerShell 7
# 4. Continue with standard recovery steps above
```

## 🎯 **Development Workflow States**

### **State 1: Working with Git Only**
```powershell
# Resume work
cdws
gs                     # Check status
gl                     # See recent commits
# Continue coding...
```

### **State 2: Working with Docker**
```powershell
# Resume work
cdws
Check-DockerReady      # Ensure Docker is running
dps                    # See running containers
di                     # Check images
# Continue development...
```

### **State 3: Working with Kubernetes/KIND**
```powershell
# Resume work
cdws
Check-DockerReady      # Ensure Docker is ready
kind-list              # Check existing clusters

# If no clusters:
kind-dev-setup         # Create fresh development cluster

# If clusters exist:
K8s-Status            # Check cluster status
kgp                   # See running pods
kgs                   # Check services

# Restore your applications
kap your-deployments/
```

## 📁 **Important File Locations**

## 🛠️ **Recovery Commands Reference**

### **Quick Status Check**
```powershell
# One-command environment check
Check-DockerReady && kind-list && gs
```

### **Full Environment Restore**
```powershell
# Complete development environment setup
cdws
Check-DockerReady
kind-dev-setup
K8s-Status
```

### **Project State Recovery**
```powershell
# Restore specific project state
kind-restore-resources "c:\app\ws\k8s-backups\your-backup.yaml"
# OR restore from Git
kap manifests/
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Seamless Continuation**

### **Before You Stop Working**
```powershell
# Save your current state
kind-backup-resources                    # Backup K8s resources
ga . && gc -m "Work in progress: [description]"  # Commit changes
gp                                       # Push to GitHub
```

### **When You Return**
```powershell
# Quick resume
cdws && Check-DockerReady && kind-dev-setup
```

### **For Long Breaks (days/weeks)**
```powershell
# Clean start approach
kind-cleanup-all                         # Clean old clusters
Docker-CleanAll                          # Clean Docker resources
kind-dev-setup                           # Fresh environment
```

## 📱 **Multi-Device Continuation**

### **On a New Machine**
1. Install PowerShell 7
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Install kubectl and KIND
4. Clone your repository: `git clone https://github.com/pyzons/powershell-enhanced-profile.git`
5. Run `.\Install-Profile.ps1`
6. Restart PowerShell 7
7. Run `kind-dev-setup`

### **Your Repository Contains Everything**
- ✅ PowerShell profile with all aliases
- ✅ Documentation and guides
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Example deployments
- ✅ Best practices guides

## 🎯 **Most Common Resume Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: "I was working on a Kubernetes app"**
```powershell
cdws
kind-dev-setup
# Look for your YAML files and apply them
ls *.yaml
kap your-deployment.yaml
kgp  # Check if pods are running
```

### **Scenario 2: "I was experimenting with Docker"**
```powershell
cdws
Check-DockerReady 
dps   # See what's running
di    # Check your images
# Continue your Docker work
```

### **Scenario 3: "I was just coding/git work"**
```powershell
cdws
gs    # Check what you were working on
gl    # See recent commits
# Continue coding
```

## 🔄 **Remember: Your Setup is Persistent!**

- ✅ **PowerShell Profile**: Auto-loads every session
- ✅ **Git Repository**: All work is backed up
- ✅ **Aliases & Functions**: Always available
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete guides in your repo
- ❌ **KIND Clusters**: Ephemeral (deleted on reboot)
- ❌ **Docker Containers**: May stop but images persist

The key is that your **tooling and shortcuts are always there** - you just need to recreate the runtime environment (KIND clusters) when needed!
