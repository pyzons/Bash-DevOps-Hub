# 🔄 How to Resume After Machine Reboot

## 🚀 **Quick Recovery Steps**

### **Step 1: Wait for Windows to Fully Load**
- ⏱️ Allow 2-3 minutes for Windows 11 to complete startup
- 🐳 Docker Desktop will auto-start (takes 30-60 seconds)

### **Step 2: Open Your Development Environment**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell 7 (your profile auto-loads!)
# Navigate to your workspace
cdws                    # Quick alias to c:\app\ws

# Check your complete environment status
Resume-Work            # One command shows everything!
```

### **Step 3: Resume Your Chat Context**
1. **Open VS Code** in your workspace: `code .`
2. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I or click chat icon)
3. **Reference this conversation**: Mention you're "continuing after reboot"
4. **Your files are all here**: All your configurations and guides are saved

## 📋 **What Survives Reboot vs What Doesn't**

### ✅ **SURVIVES (Permanent)**
- ✅ Your PowerShell profile with 60+ aliases
- ✅ All your files in `c:\app\ws\`
- ✅ Git repository (fully synced)
- ✅ Docker Desktop installation
- ✅ kubectl and KIND binaries
- ✅ All your documentation and guides
- ✅ VS Code settings and extensions

### ❌ **DOESN'T SURVIVE (Ephemeral)**
- ❌ KIND clusters (deleted on reboot)
- ❌ This chat conversation context
- ❌ Running Docker containers
- ❌ Terminal session history

## 🎯 **Resuming Your Development Work**

### **Scenario 1: General Development**
```powershell
cdws                   # Go to workspace
Resume-Work           # Check environment status
gs                    # Check git status
# Continue where you left off
```

### **Scenario 2: Kubernetes Development**
```powershell
cdws                   # Go to workspace
Resume-Work           # Check environment status
kind-dev-setup        # Recreate KIND cluster
K8s-Status           # Verify cluster is ready
# Deploy your applications
kap your-manifests/
```

### **Scenario 3: Had Running Applications**
```powershell
cdws                   # Go to workspace
Resume-Work           # Check environment status
kind-dev-setup        # Recreate KIND cluster

# Option A: Restore from backup
kind-restore-resources c:\app\ws\k8s-backups\your-backup.yaml

# Option B: Redeploy from Git
kap manifests/
```
